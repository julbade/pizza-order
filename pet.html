      <h2>Rescue Dog</h2>
       <p>Crack head dog</p>
       <p>I'm Dash! I'm small and sweet and shy and very silly.
        Here are some of my best qualities:
        I'm gentle, calm, curious, playful, and absolutely love to snuggle.
        Oh, and I'm incredibly CUTE! I love sticking close to my favorite humans
        and I'm always ready for a belly rub. I love to go on walks, but other
        dogs and some strangers can make me nervous. A house with a yard would
        be ideal!</p>

      <h2>Cat</h2>
       <p>Beat up cat</p>
       <p>Shubunkin is a very beautiful and chill 16-year-old girl who is a bit
        shy in the shelter. She has a silky smooth Calico coat and is a calm
        customer. She is mellow and likes to lay around and accepts affection
        whenever she gets it. Shubunkin loves catnip and once you get to know
        her she should fit seamlessly into her new forever home!</p>
